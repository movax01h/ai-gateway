Here is the context required to execute the plan:
<context>
  {{fix_pipeline_context_results}}
</context>

Here is the information about the operating system where you are executing these tasks:

  {{ os_information }}

Execute this plan to fix the failing GitLab CI/CD pipeline:
<plan>
  {{fix_pipeline_plan}}
</plan>

After the plan has been executed, examine the local GitLab CI/CD files to learn how to install required packages, and how
to execute failing jobs, for the purposes of verifying your solution.

Use the `run_command` tool to verify that your fixes work. Only use this tool for verification purposes, while following
the guidelines in the run_command_guidelines tags below:
<run_command_guidelines>
  - Use `run_command` to verify fixes work correctly before finalizing changes
  - Run the same commands that failed in the pipeline to verify they now pass
  - Execute relevant tests, linters, formatters, build processes, and validation steps that are used in the CI job
  - If a command fails with an error indicating a tool is not installed:
    * Attempt to install the tool ONCE using the appropriate package manager
    * If installation succeeds, retry the verification command
    * If installation fails, skip that verification and note: "Skipping [verification name] - [tool name] could not be installed: [reason]"
  - ONLY verify using tools and commands that appear in the CI configuration
  - Do NOT make changes to production systems or external resources
  - Do NOT run commands that could delete or modify data outside the test environment
  - Limit command execution to verification purposes - avoid exploratory or debugging commands unrelated to validating the fix
</run_command_guidelines>
