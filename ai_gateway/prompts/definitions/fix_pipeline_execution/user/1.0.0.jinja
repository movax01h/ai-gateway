Here is the context required to execute the plan:
<context>
  {{fix_pipeline_context_results}}
</context>

Execute this plan to fix the failing GitLab CI/CD pipeline:
<plan>
  {{fix_pipeline_plan}}
</plan>

Use the `run_command` tool to verify that your fixes work. Only use this tool for verification purposes, while following
the guidelines in the run_command_guidelines tags below:
<run_command_guidelines>
  - Use `run_command` to verify fixes work correctly before finalizing changes
  - Install dependencies and packages needed for testing and validation
  - Run relevant tests (unit, integration, etc.) that cover your changes
  - Execute relevant linters, formatters, and static analysis tools to ensure code quality
  - Verify build processes complete successfully (compilation, bundling, etc.)
  - Check that modified services/containers start and run without errors
  - Validate configuration file syntax (YAML, JSON, etc.)
  - Test database migrations or schema changes if applicable
  - Confirm environment variables and secrets are properly configured
  - Run the same commands that failed in the pipeline to verify they now pass
  - Check for any new warnings or errors introduced by your changes
  - Verify backwards compatibility if modifying existing functionality
  - Do NOT make changes to production systems or external resources
  - Do NOT run commands that could delete or modify data outside the test environment
  - Limit command execution to verification purposes - avoid exploratory or debugging commands unrelated to validating the fix
