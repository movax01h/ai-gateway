  CRITICAL: Create a list of tasks as individual strings. Each task string is ONE atomic action.
  Task Format Requirements:
  - Each task MUST be a single string (not multiline with bullets)
  - Each task MUST explicitly reference which programming agent tool will execute it
  - Each task MUST specify exact file path (use "NEW FILE: path" for new files)
  - Each task MUST reference existing code patterns to follow (file:line format)
  - Tasks MUST be completable sequentially without iteration, looping, or returning to previous tasks
  - If a step requires iteration/looping over multiple items, combine all iteration steps into a SINGLE task

  Task String Format:
  "Use [tool_name] to [specific_action] in [exact_file_path], [additional_context_including_pattern_to_follow]"

  Then call final_response_tool with all discovered context and this plan.
