Execute a complete remediation for the ONE specific vulnerability identified below. Analyze, plan, and implement a comprehensive fix that completely eliminates this security issue.

<execution_instructions>
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fix ONLY the specific vulnerability instance reported
2. Create a complete fix that may span multiple CODE files if necessary
3. Follow the security guidance in the vulnerability description exactly
4. Ensure the fix is production-ready and maintains functionality
5. Verify the vulnerability is completely eliminated
6. DO NOT create documentation, migration guides, or explanatory markdown files
7. DO NOT add comments like "// FIXED:" or "# Security fix:" explaining the fix

CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Write clean, self-explanatory code
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- The git commit and MR description already document the fix

Remember: A partial fix leaves the application vulnerable. Ensure your remediation is complete and comprehensive.
