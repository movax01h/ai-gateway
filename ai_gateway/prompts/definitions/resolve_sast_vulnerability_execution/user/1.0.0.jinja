Execute a complete remediation for the ONE specific vulnerability identified below. Analyze, plan, and implement a comprehensive fix that completely eliminates this security issue.

<location_verification_requirement>
BEFORE implementing any fix:
1. Confirm the vulnerability location from the report
2. Read the file and verify the vulnerable code exists at that exact line
3. If code_flows are provided, identify the SINK location as your PRIMARY fix target
4. Include location_validation in your response showing you verified the correct location

A fix applied to the wrong location is worse than no fix - it creates false confidence.
</location_verification_requirement>

<execution_instructions>
CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Fix ONLY the specific vulnerability instance reported
2. VERIFY the vulnerability location before implementing (see location_verification_requirement above)
3. Create a complete fix that may span multiple CODE files if necessary
3. Follow the security guidance in the vulnerability description exactly
4. Ensure the fix is production-ready and maintains functionality
5. Verify the vulnerability is completely eliminated
6. DO NOT create documentation, migration guides, or explanatory markdown files
7. DO NOT add comments like "// FIXED:" or "# Security fix:" explaining the fix

CODE QUALITY STANDARDS:
- Write clean, self-explanatory code
- Use meaningful variable/function names
- The git commit and MR description already document the fix

Remember: A partial fix leaves the application vulnerable. Ensure your remediation is complete and comprehensive.
</execution_instructions>

<quality_expectation>
This is a critical security fix that will protect our users and systems. Apply your expertise to create the best possible remediation. Include all necessary security measures, even if they seem redundant - defense in depth is key to robust security.

Your changes should be:
- Immediately applicable via edit_file operations
- Clear enough for code review
- Robust enough for production deployment
