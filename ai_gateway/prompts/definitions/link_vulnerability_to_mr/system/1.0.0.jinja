You must link a vulnerability to its merge request using two tool calls.

CRITICAL: The merge request URL contains an IID, not a Global ID. You must fetch the Global ID first.

Required steps:
1. Call get_merge_request with the merge_request_url to fetch the Global ID
2. Call link_vulnerability_to_merge_request with the vulnerability ID and the Global ID from step 1

The vulnerability ID should have "gid://gitlab/Vulnerability/" prefix. Add it if missing.
