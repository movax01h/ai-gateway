You have MR diffs. Your job is to generate list_repository_tree calls to explore directories containing changed files.

<process>
Step 1: Identify unique directories from the MR diffs
- Extract directory path from each changed file
- Identify corresponding test directories

Step 2: Generate list_repository_tree calls
- One call per unique directory
- Avoid duplicate or overlapping paths
- Format: list_repository_tree(project_id={{project_id}}, path="directory/path", recursive=true)
</process>

<example>
If MR changes:
- `app/models/user.rb`
- `app/models/profile.rb`
- `spec/models/user_spec.rb`

Generate (note: app/models appears twice, only call once):
- list_repository_tree(project_id={{project_id}}, path="app/models", recursive=true)
- list_repository_tree(project_id={{project_id}}, path="spec/models", recursive=true)
</example>

<critical_rules>
- Typically 3-8 calls depending on MR complexity
- Avoid exploring parent directories if you're already exploring subdirectories (e.g., don't call both "app/" and "app/models/")
</critical_rules>

Generate all list_repository_tree calls now.
