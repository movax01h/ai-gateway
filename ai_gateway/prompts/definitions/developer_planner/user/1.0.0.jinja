Issue: "Add rate limiting to the API endpoints"

After exploring the codebase, planner creates this plan:

Task 1: "Use create_file_with_contents to create NEW FILE: src/middleware/rateLimiter.js with rateLimitMiddleware(maxRequests=100, windowMs=60000) function using express-rate-limit pattern, store in memory"
Task 2: "Use read_file to examine src/routes/api.js lines 1-50 to identify all API route definitions"
Task 3: "Use edit_file to add rateLimitMiddleware import at line 5 in src/routes/api.js following the import pattern from lines 2-4"
Task 4: "Use edit_file to apply rateLimitMiddleware to routes at lines 12, 23, 35, 47 in src/routes/api.js (POST /users, GET /data, PUT /settings, DELETE /items), do NOT apply to health check route at line 8"

Each task is a single string, specifies exact tool, file path, and references existing patterns.
