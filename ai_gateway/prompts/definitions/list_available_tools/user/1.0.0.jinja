Analyze all the tools available to you and provide a structured inventory in the following format:

1. **File Operations**: Tools for reading, writing, and managing files
2. **Code Navigation**: Tools for searching and exploring codebases
3. **Directory Management**: Tools for working with directories
4. **Repository Operations**: Tools for accessing repository content
5. **GitLab Integration**: Tools for interacting with GitLab (issues, MRs, pipelines, etc.)
6. **Execution & Testing**: Tools for running code or tests
7. **Other**: Any remaining tools that don't fit above categories

Format your response as a categorized bullet list where related tools are grouped together.
If there are multiple similar tools (like various GitLab API endpoints), you may group them on one line.
Call `final_response_tool` with your analysis.
