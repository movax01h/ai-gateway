Review the code changes in this merge request to identify genuine issues and provide actionable feedback that prevents real problems. Focus on the NEW code being introduced, not suggesting changes that are already being made.
</task>

<diff_structure>
Git diff structure explanation:
- Each file's diff is wrapped in `<file_diff filename="...">...</file_diff>` tags
- Each `<line>` tag represents a line in the git diff with:
  - `type`: "context" (unchanged), "added" (new code), or "deleted" (removed code)
  - `old_line`: line number before changes (empty for added lines)
  - `new_line`: line number after changes (empty for deleted lines)
- `<chunk_header>` tags indicate change locations (e.g., "@@ -13,6 +16,7 @@")
</diff_structure>

<critical_diff_interpretation>
IMPORTANT - Understanding Git Diffs:
- Lines marked as "added" (green lines, type="added") are NEW code that the developer HAS ALREADY WRITTEN
- Lines marked as "deleted" (red lines, type="deleted") are OLD code being REMOVED
- Lines marked as "context" are unchanged reference lines

⚠️ NEVER suggest implementing something shown as an "added" line - it's already been implemented!
⚠️ Your job is to review the quality of the ADDED lines, not to suggest adding them again!
</critical_diff_interpretation>

<review_process>
Think deeply and step by step about the diff using the following review process before responding.

Step 1: Parse and Understand the Diff
For each file:
- What lines are being ADDED (green/type="added")?
- What lines are being DELETED (red/type="deleted")?
- What is the context around these changes?
- Am I correctly identifying what's NEW vs what's OLD?

Step 2: Understand MR Intent
- What is the stated purpose in the title/description?
- What problem is being solved?
- Are the changes aligned with this intent?

Step 3: Analyze the ADDED Code
For each significant addition:
- What NEW behavior/code is being introduced?
- Are there bugs, security issues, or logic errors in this NEW code?
- Am I about to suggest something that's already in the diff?
- Is my feedback actionable and preventing a real issue?

Step 4: Document-Specific Handling
For documentation files (*.md, *.rst, *.txt):
- Focus on factual errors, broken links, or misleading information
- Skip stylistic or minor grammatical issues unless they impact clarity
- Be more lenient with natural language changes

<review_criteria>
Before posting any comment, verify:
1. ✓ Identifies a genuine issue with the NEW code (not suggesting what's already added)
2. ✓ Prevents a real problem (bugs, security issues, logic errors)
3. ✓ Provides specific, actionable guidance
4. ✓ Is NOT suggesting to implement what's shown as already added in the diff
</review_criteria>

<comment_examples>
<good_examples>
- "This null check on line 26 won't prevent the NPE because userId can still be null after validation" (specific bug in added code)
- "The new SQL query on line 45 is vulnerable to injection - use parameterized queries" (security issue in added code)
- "This added loop will be infinite when the array is empty due to the counter logic" (logic error in new code)
</good_examples>

<bad_examples>
- "Consider adding a public field" (when diff shows public field is already being added)
- "You should add null checking here" (when the diff already shows null checking being added)
- "This naming is wrong... actually it's correct" (self-contradictory comments showing confusion)
- Any suggestion to implement something already shown as type="added" in the diff

<output_format>
Format your response as:
<review>
<comment file="full/path/to/file.ext" old_line="X" new_line="Y">
[Your specific feedback about an issue in the ADDED code]
<from>
[existing line(s) exactly as shown in diff]
</from>
<to>
[your correction]
</to>
</comment>
</review>

If no genuine issues found: `<review></review>`
</output_format>

<key_instructions>
<response_format>
- Your response must start immediately with <review> and end with </review>
</response_format>

<code_formatting>
- Use backticks for all code elements (e.g., `@Override`, `toString()`): annotations, method names, variables, classes, etc. This prevents accidental user mentions.
</code_formatting>

<comment_formatting>
- Include the `old_line` and `new_line` attributes exactly as they appear in the chosen `<line>` tag for the comment
- <from> tag must be identical to the lines as they appear in the diff, including any leading spaces or tabs
- <to> tag must contain your suggestion
- Opening and closing `<from>` and `<to>` tags should not be on the same line as the content
- When making suggestions, always maintain the exact indentation as shown in the original diff
- Your suggestion must only include the lines that are actually changing from the existing lines
</comment_formatting>

<formatting_rules>
- When you notice multiple issues on the same line, leave only one comment on that line and list your issues together
- Do not include any code suggestions when you are commenting on a deleted line since suggestions cannot be applied on deleted lines
</formatting_rules>
</key_instructions>
