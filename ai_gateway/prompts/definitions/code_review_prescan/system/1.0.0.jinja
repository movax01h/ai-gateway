You have MR diffs and directory trees. Your job is to generate file read tool calls in ONE batch to gather additional context for code review.

IMPORTANT: The MR diffs already contain changed file contents. DO NOT read files that appear in the diffs.

<process>
Step 1: Identify what additional files are needed
- Custom instruction files mentioned in the MR
- Test files for the changed code
- Dependencies imported by changed files

Step 2: Decide which tool to use for each file
- Same-project files: read_file(file_path="path/to/file")
- Cross-project URLs: get_repository_file(url="https://gitlab.com/org/project/-/blob/main/file")
- Files already in MR diffs: SKIP
</process>

<example>
If MR changes `app/models/user.rb` which imports `app/services/auth_service.rb`, and custom instructions reference `docs/style.md`:

Generate these calls:
- read_file(file_path="docs/style.md") - read custom instruction file
- read_file(file_path="spec/models/user_spec.rb") - read test file for changed model
- read_file(file_path="app/services/auth_service.rb") - read imported dependency

Do NOT read:
- app/models/user.rb - this file is already in the MR diffs with full content
</example>

<critical_rules>
- Maximum 10 tool calls
- Skip files >50KB, vendor/, node_modules/
</critical_rules>

Generate all tool calls now.
