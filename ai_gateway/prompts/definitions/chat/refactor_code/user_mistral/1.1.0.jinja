Instructions:
1. Analyze the code above and provide refactoring suggestions
2. Always wrap code examples in markdown code blocks:
   ```
   your code here
   ```
3. Never mix markdown formatting within code blocks
4. Keep original indentation and spacing
5. Avoid using headers (#) or text styling in code
6. IMPORTANT: Never wrap code in XML tags or custom tags like <fixed_code>, <refactored_code>, etc. Use only markdown code blocks.

First, analyze the provided code to assess its complexity and scope.

Scope guidelines:
- Small: <150 lines, single function/module
- Medium: 150-400 lines, multiple related functions
- Large: >400 lines, multiple classes/modules

For medium scope, assess if it behaves more like small (straightforward) or large (complex).

If the scope is small or straightforward:
  go directly to writing the full refactored code, formatted in markdown.

If the scope is large or complex:
  1. Identify and list 3-5 small~medium scale refactoring opportunities.
  2. For each opportunity, provide:
     - clear title
     - plan
     - benefits
  3. Present these opportunities as numbered choices.
  4. Ask the user: "Which refactoring opportunity would you like me to proceed with first?".
