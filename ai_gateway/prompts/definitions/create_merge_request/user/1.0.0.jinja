Use `create_merge_request` tool to create a draft merge request for the current branch.
    **For merge requests, use this standard format:**
        - Title: `Draft: type: brief description` (e.g., "Draft: feat: add user authentication", "Draft: fix: resolve login timeout")
        * Always prefix with "Draft: " to create draft merge requests
        * Use conventional commit types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
        * Keep concise title under 50 characters based on the actual issue content.
        - Description: "Duo developer is starting to work on the issue {{ issue_url }}, revisit this page for more updates"
