<analysis_steps>
1. **Extract vulnerability information**:
   - File path: location.file
   - Line number: location.startLine
   - Commit SHA: from location.blobPath (extract the SHA) or use default branch
   - Vulnerability type: from title and description
   - Project ID: from project.id (extract numeric ID from GID format)

2. **Read the vulnerable file**:
   - Use get_repository_file with the project ID, file path, and correct ref/commit
   - Examine the code at and around the flagged line
   - Identify the vulnerable function/method/code block

3. **Understand the vulnerability type**:
   - What makes this vulnerability exploitable?
   - What inputs/conditions are required for exploitation?
   - What protections would prevent exploitation?

4. **Perform cross-file data flow analysis** (CRITICAL):
   - Use gitlab_blob_search to find ALL callers of the vulnerable function
   - For each caller, trace where arguments originate
   - Search for the function/method name, class name, and key variables
   - Look for imports of this module in other files
   - Check for validation/sanitization in ANY file in the call chain
   - Examine base classes, mixins, and parent functions
   - Look for middleware, decorators, or configuration-based protections
   - **If searches return no results**: Document this and analyze the vulnerable code in isolation (do not assume it's safe)

5. **Check for protection mechanisms**:
   - Search for validation functions, sanitizers, or security utilities
   - Look for framework security features (ORM, template escaping, etc.)
   - Check for middleware, decorators, or base class protections
   - Examine configuration files for security settings
   - Review imports and dependencies for security libraries

6. **Evaluate the evidence**:
   - Is this test code or production code?
   - Did you find validation/sanitization in the data flow?
   - Is the vulnerability pattern fundamentally inapplicable here?
   - What is the complete data flow from entry point to sink?
   - Are there compensating controls at any point in the flow?
   - **Note**: If cross-file searches failed or returned no results, this is incomplete analysis - do not use it to justify a high false positive score (61+)

7. **Score the likelihood**:
   - Use the 0-100 scale provided in the system prompt
   - 0-60: Proceed with fix (true positive or uncertain)
   - 61-100: Skip as false positive (likely or definitely false positive)
   - Provide detailed reasoning for your score
</analysis_steps>

<reminder>
- **CRITICAL**: Perform thorough cross-file data flow analysis
- Look for validation in SEPARATE FILES/FUNCTIONS (most common false positive indicator)
- Document the complete data flow path: Entry Point → Function Chain → Sink
- When uncertain, lean toward proceeding with fix (0-60 range)
- **If search tools fail or return no results**: This means incomplete analysis, NOT that the code is safe - stay in 0-60 range
- Document which searches failed and why the analysis may be incomplete
- Provide a likelihood score (0-100) with detailed explanation
- Output ONLY the routing value: proceed_with_fix (0-60) or skip_false_positive (61-100)
</reminder>

Perform your analysis using the available tools, then call final_response_tool with exactly:
- proceed_with_fix
- OR
- skip_false_positive

Provide your analysis first, then output the routing value on a new line with no additional text.
