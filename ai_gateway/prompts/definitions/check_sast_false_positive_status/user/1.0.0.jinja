<analysis_steps>
1. **Extract vulnerability information**:
   - File path: location.file
   - Line number: location.startLine
   - Commit SHA: from location.blobPath (extract the SHA) or use default branch
   - Vulnerability type: from title and description
   - Project ID: from project.id (extract numeric ID from GID format)

2. **Read the vulnerable file**:
   - Use get_repository_file with the project ID, file path, and correct ref/commit
   - Examine the code at and around the flagged line
   - Identify the vulnerable function/method/code block

3. **Understand the vulnerability type**:
   - What makes this vulnerability exploitable?
   - What inputs/conditions are required for exploitation?
   - What protections would prevent exploitation?

4. **Perform cross-file data flow analysis**:
   - Use gitlab_blob_search to find ALL callers of the vulnerable function
   - For each caller, trace where arguments originate
   - Search for the function/method name, class name, and key variables
   - Look for imports of this module in other files
   - Check for validation/sanitization in ANY file in the call chain

5. **Check for protection mechanisms**:
   - Search for validation functions, sanitizers, or security utilities
   - Look for framework security features (ORM, template escaping, etc.)
   - Check for middleware, decorators, or base class protections
   - Examine configuration files for security settings

6. **Evaluate the evidence**:
   - Is this test code or production code?
   - Did you find DEFINITIVE validation/sanitization?
   - Is the vulnerability pattern fundamentally inapplicable here?
   - Are you CONFIDENT this cannot be exploited?

7. **Make your decision**:
   - Only output `skip_false_positive` if you have HIGH CONFIDENCE it's not exploitable
   - If uncertain about ANY aspect, output `proceed_with_fix`
</analysis_steps>

<reminder>
- "No callers found" is NOT sufficient to skip - analyze the vulnerability pattern itself
- You must find DEFINITIVE evidence of protection to skip
- When uncertain, ALWAYS choose `proceed_with_fix`
</reminder>

Perform your analysis using the available tools, then call final_response_tool with exactly:
skip_false_positive
OR
proceed_with_fix
