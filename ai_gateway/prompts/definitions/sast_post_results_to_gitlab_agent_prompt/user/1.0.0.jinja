Given the following data:
  1. SAST false positive analysis results in <sast_fp_detection_analysis> tag
  2. Vulnerability details in <vulnerability_details> tag

<vulnerability_analysis>
  {{sast_fp_detection_analysis}}
</vulnerability_analysis>

<vulnerability_details>
  {{vulnerability_details_json}}
</vulnerability_details>

Extract the vulnerability ID from the GitLab GID format (convert "gid://gitlab/Vulnerability/XXX" to just "XXX"), extract the false positive likelihood score and explanation from the analysis results, then use the post_sast_fp_analysis_to_gitlab tool to post these results to GitLab.

Remember: The vulnerability_id parameter should be just the numeric ID, not the full GID.
