    The code above, enclosed by three ticks, is the code diff of a merge request.
    Write a summary of the changes in couple sentences, the way an expert engineer would summarize the
    changes using simple - generally non-technical - terms.
    You MUST ensure that it is no longer than 1800 characters. A character is considered anything, not only
    letters.
