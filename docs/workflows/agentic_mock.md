# Using the agentic mock model

The [agentic mock model](../../ai_gateway/models/agentic_mock.py) lets you simulate multi-step workflows by specifying mock responses in your input.

Enable the agentic mock by setting both environment variables:

```shell
export AIGW_MOCK_MODEL_RESPONSES=true
export AIGW_USE_AGENTIC_MOCK=true
```

## Simple responses

Include your desired response in `<response>` tags in your input:

```xml
Summarize this issue for me.

<response>
  This issue discusses implementing a new authentication system with OAuth2 support.
</response>
```

## Tool calls

Include tool calls using `<tool_calls>` tags with JSON arrays:

```xml
Analyze the security implications of this code.

<response>
  I need to examine the code structure first.
  <tool_calls>
    [{"name": "read_file", "args": {"path": "src/auth.py"}}]
  </tool_calls>
</response>
```

Tool call requirements:

- Must be a JSON array: `[{"name": "tool1"}, {"name": "tool2"}]`
- Each tool call must have a `name` field
- Optional `args` field for parameters

## Sequential responses

Use multiple `<response>` tags to simulate multi-turn conversations:

```xml
Create a comprehensive test plan.

<response>
  I'll start by analyzing the requirements.
  <tool_calls>
    [{"name": "get_requirements", "args": {"project": "auth-system"}}]
  </tool_calls>
</response>
<response>
  Based on the requirements, here's the comprehensive test plan:

  1. Unit tests for authentication flows
  2. Integration tests for OAuth2 providers
  3. Security penetration tests
</response>
```

Note: at least one tool call must be included in a response for the agent to process the next response, as expected by [the workflow graph for Agentic Chat](../duo_workflow_service_graphs.md#graph-chat). The first `<response>` without a tool call will end the simulated workflow.

## Latency simulation

Add delays using the `latency_ms` attribute to specify the number of milliseconds the mock model should wait before returning the response:

```xml
<response latency_ms='1500'>
  This response will be delayed by 1.5 seconds
</response>
```

## Example workflows

Workflow with 2 tool calls:

```xml
Review this pull request for security issues.

<response>
  I'll examine the changes systematically.
  <tool_calls>
    [{"name": "get_pr_files", "args": {"pr_id": "123"}}]
  </tool_calls>
</response>
<response>
  I found several security concerns:
  1. SQL injection vulnerability in user input handling
  2. Missing authentication checks on admin endpoints
  <tool_calls>
    [{
      "name": "create_security_report",
      "args": {"pr_id": "123", "issues": ["sql_injection", "auth_bypass"]}
    }]
  </tool_calls>
</response>
<response>
  Security report created. I recommend addressing these issues before merging.
</response>
```

Workflow with simulated latency for 2 tool calls:

```xml
Help me understand this bug report.

<response latency_ms='800'>
  Let me gather information about this issue.
  <tool_calls>
    [{"name": "search_similar_issues", "args": {"keywords": ["authentication", "timeout"]}}]
  </tool_calls>
</response>
<response latency_ms='1200'>
  Based on similar issues, this appears to be related to session timeout handling.
  <tool_calls>
    [{"name": "get_code_context", "args": {"file": "session_manager.py", "line": 45}}]
  </tool_calls>
</response>
<response>
  The bug is in the session timeout logic.
  The fix is to update the session renewal mechanism in `session_manager.py`.
</response>
```
